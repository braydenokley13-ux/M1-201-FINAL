# TODO Tracker

Use this file to quickly assign next coding tasks to Codex or Claude.

## Core TODO IDs
- None currently active. Add new `TODO(ID)` entries in code first, then list them here.

## Fast command to locate TODOs
```bash
rg -n "# TODO" src scripts README.md DEPLOY.md TODO_TRACKER.md assets/README.md
```
